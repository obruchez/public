<a name="9"></a>2014/03/09 | Toshiba | MK5065GSXF 500GB 2.5" SATA 2.6/ATA-8 | Failed in my late-2011 MacBook Pro. Replaced the drive before it actually crashed, after getting S.M.A.R.T. errors from SMARTReporter. No data loss.
<a name="8"></a>2011/01/23 | Western Digital | Caviar Green WD20EADS 2TB SATA | Failed in a Drobo array. Array rebuilt without any data loss (diff with backup okay).
<a name="7"></a>2009/09/19 | Samsung | MCBQE32GBMPP 32GB Flash 2.5" SATA SSD | Caused by excessive heat. I don't know whether it was the motherboard or the hard drive that crashed/failed.
<a name="6"></a>2008/12/17 | Hitachi | Deskstar 7K500 500GB SATA II | Failed in a 4-drive RAID 5 array. Had a replacement ready. Array restored without any problem. No data was lost. Apparently, the hard drive didn't really crash, but the RAID controller was on a "dying" motherboard.
